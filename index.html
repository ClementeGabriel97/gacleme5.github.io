      <p class="paragraph">The Simpsons which started in 1989 has
        been a cartoon comedy that has continued to this day and
        already has a new season for 2023. The Simpsons takes place in a
        place called Springfield (state is unknown). The main cast is a 5 person family. <b>Homer</b>
        the father of the family works in the nuclear power plant and like to hang out at "Moe's"
        the town's local tavern. <b>Marge</b> the mother of the family and the glue that keeps everyone together.
        She is the family's official homemaker that supports the entire family. <b>Bart</b>, the 10 year old hell-raiser and the first born and only
        son in the Simpson family. He is in the fourth grade causing mischief at home, school and
        pretty much anywhere he goes. This is usually with his trusty best friend Milhouse.
        <b>Lisa</b>, "Springfield's answer to a question no one asked" the smartest of the group
        and usually the voice of reason in her chaotic family. She is also a straight 'A'
        student and loves to play the saxophone. Last but definitely not least <b>Maggie</b>. The literal
        baby of the family. Even though she is only a baby she has done so much like
        saving her father from drowning, shot Mr. Burns, forced Homer to
        work back at the nuclear power plant and much more. </p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Now I just mentioned just the main family featured, and it already sounds like a pretty crazy show. The show also goes into stories of other members
        of the Simpson family and the whole town. They have celebrity appearances
        either as themselves or playing a new out of town characters. I enjoy the satire
        of the show and how they're spoofs of t.v/ movies back in the 80's and 90's.
